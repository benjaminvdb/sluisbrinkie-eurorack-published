# Introduction
The Andes is the brainproduct of the people on the Sourcery Studios Discord. We love the Beaks but wished it had CV inputs. 
So we got to work and made an upgraded version of the [Beaks](https://github.com/SourceryOne/Beaks) / [$peaks](https://github.com/matias-levy/peaks) . Currently there are 3 variants: 8HP (SMD), 10HP (THT) and 12HP (THT). Below is a picture of the 8HP version.

# Revision log
19-10-2024: The prototypes of both the 8HP and 10HP are assembled and being tested. **We did discover a few mistakes so don't use the current version just yet!**
The layout of the 12HP is still work-in-progress. 

06-11-2024: A new revision of the Andes 8HP is made and this seems to have resolved the issues!

25-01-2025: We discovered that the output has a bit of DC offset and that the knob range isn't utilized in full. Luckily, it's quite easy to improve this. It only require 2 resistors to be replaced with a different value. See the image.

# Build Tips and other remarks
- There is no separate software buid for the Andes, refer to this repository for firmware builds: [$peaks](https://github.com/matias-levy/peaks) 
- A note with respect to the iBoms of the Andes 8HP, the female headers for connecting the STM Bluepill are not listed in the iBOM (the csv bom correctly shows them). They are 01x20 2.54mm female pinheaders (or pinsockets).
- There are some different variations in bluepill pinouts, please double-check that you have the correct one, to avoid damaging anything.
- The B10K potmeter holes are slightly bigger and can accomodate potmeters with bushing. The B100k potmeter holes can only accomodate bushless pots (would recommend using 'tall trimmer pots' but different shaft types also work).
- If you don't use potmeters with bushing, it's recommended to add spacers and bolts / nuts to fixate the Front PCB and frontpanel together. The hole size is M2.5.
- Green leds / knobs can be used but are fairly dim. So it's recommended to use the red color Ã³r adjust the current limiting resistors to increase brightness.
- The buttons I use in the picture are the 'Black Small Unskirted D - Sifam Plastic Knob' from Thonk (for size reference).
- The USB port from the STM should be pointed towards the power connector.
- There are iBOMs in /Hardware/andes_8hp/bom and /Hardware/andes_8hp/front_pcb/bom/ for the back PCB and front PCB respectively.
