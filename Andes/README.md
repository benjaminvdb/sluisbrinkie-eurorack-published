The Andes is the brainproduct of the people on the Sourcery Studios Discord. We love the Beaks but wished it had CV inputs. 
So we got to work and made an upgraded version of the [Beaks](https://github.com/SourceryOne/Beaks) / [$peaks](https://github.com/matias-levy/peaks) . Currently there are 3 variants: 8HP (SMD), 10HP (THT) and 12HP (THT). 

As of the 19th of October, the prototypes of both the 8HP and 10HP are assembled and being tested. **We did discover a few mistakes so don't use the current version just yet!**
The layout of the 12HP is still work-in-progress. 
Below is a picture of the 8HP version.
