# Sluisbrinkie Faraday

The Faraday (named after a certain Scientist) is an all-analog VCA/VCF combo using the SSI2164. The top section is a traditional VCA, the middle section is a 1-pole filter modeled after the revered SSM2040 VCF (which is very colorful and can double as an overdrive) and finally the bottom section is a 2-pole State Variable Filter with high-pass, band-pass and low-pass filter outputs (which can be mixed externally to obtain a notch filter). The output of the VCA is normalled to the input of the SSM2040-style filter. The schematic can be found in this directory.

In case you bought a PCB (with assembled SMD components) and panel from me, there are a number of things you need to finish the build:

- 1x SSI2614 (SMD, this needs to be soldered manually)
- 11x Thonkiconn mono jacks
- 1x 100kOhm Type A potentiometer (Bourns PVT09 series are used in my personal builds)
- 3x 10kOhm Type B potentiometer (Bourns PVT09 series are used in my personal builds)
- 2x 100kOhm Type B potentiometer (Bourns PVT09 series are used in my personal builds)
- 6x potentiometer knobs
- 1x 2x5 pinheader (for eurorack power supply)
- 1x 10-pins ribbon cable (for eurorack power supply)
