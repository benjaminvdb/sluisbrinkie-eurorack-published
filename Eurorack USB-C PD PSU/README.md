# Description
I needed a PSU that could source more current than the one I already had, and I liked the idea of implementing USB-C PD (because I almost always have a USB-C adapter lying around somewhere). I found the PD_Micro project and liked the idea of using that as a starting point (as I often use 32U4s). I added Isolated DC-DC converters, an eFuse, a WS2812B led for status indication and made some more changes to make it work for my purpose.

The boards have been tested and are functional but the software still has limited features (for example, current monitoring is not really implemented).
