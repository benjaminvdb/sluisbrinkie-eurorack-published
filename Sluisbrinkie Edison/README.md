# Sluisbrinkie Edison

The Edison is named after the well-known scientist. Now you might be looking at the module and wondering what the link is to the scientist but Edison is the man who patented the Phonograph, a device that could be used for the recording and playback of sound, just like this module! You can record audio into the internal recording buffer, via the built-in microphone or the jack input, and play it back. It's a 6HP-wide module and is built around the ISD1820. It can produce a wide spectrum of sounds ranging from tasty lofi to absolute glitch fests.

## Tips, Tricks and How-to's
- For detailed insights in how the ISD chip works internally, refer to chapter 5 of the datasheet (in the same folder as this ReadMe).
- The record button is debounced inside the ISD1820, causing a short delay (84ms) between the button press and the chip starting its recording.
- Due to the way the ISD chip works, a higher CV actually means a lower pitch. Using it in conjunction with an inverter/attenuverter is recommended for rudimentary pitch tracking.
- When pressing the trigger button (or applying a trigger on the trigger jack), the audio recorded in the buffer will play from start to finish once.
- When pressing (and holding) the gate, the audio will play from start for as long as the gate is held high. When looping is not enabled, it will stop playback at the end of the recording buffer. If the gate is released and activated again, it will start playback from the beginning.
- Looping mode is enabled when the Loop Switch is pointing upwards. It will auto-trigger itself to play the recording buffer continuously in a loop.
- The Input switch selects between the microphone input and the jack input (labeled Audio In). When the switch is pointing upwards, the microphone is selected. The Audio In is selected in the downward position.
- In Feedthrough mode (Enabled when the FT Switch is pointing upwards), the microphone is muted and the Audio In can be used to feed a signal straight through the chip (without passing through the recording buffer). In this mode, the ISD functions as a noisy, lofi low-pass filter. The pitch knob and CV control the cut-off frequency. The input switch should also be adjusted such that the Audio In is selected.

## BOM for DIY Build
In case you bought a kit, all SMD components are already soldered onto the board. To finish the build, a number of components are required: 
- 6x Thonkiconn mono jacks
- 2x 100kOhm potentiometer (in my personal builds, I use the Bourns PTV09A-4020F-B104. But any equivalent will fit of course!) 
- 1x 3mm LED (color of choice)
- 3x sub-miniature toggle switches
- 1x 2x5 pinheader (for eurorack power supply)
- 1x ISD1820 
- IC socket for ISD1820
- 1x electret microphone (make sure to buy one with long enough leads, in order to mount it level with the frontplate). The one in the picture is the "Electret Microphone Ã¸9.7 x 6.7 mm" from Thonk. Other types can be used but may sound different and louder / quieter.

## Jumper Description
When asssembling, you will notice a couple of jumpers. These give the option to customize the behaviour of the ISD chip.

  1. The first one is mandatory to solder for a correctly functioning microphone. I bridged 1 and 2 to ensure that the microphone is muted when not recording (to avoid feedback in the Feedthrough mode)
  2. The second one can be used to enable the record button (I found that I sometimes accidentally touch the record button and thereby clearing the recorded buffer). Normally it would be recommended to solder this jumper.
  3. Number 3 gives control over the Automatic Gain. it can be left floating to enable AGC but it can also be forced high or low to get a fixed gain.
  4. Number 4 can be used to create a ramp on the AGC (causing a fade in).
