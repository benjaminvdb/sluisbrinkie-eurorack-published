# Sluisbrinkie Edison

The Edison is named after the well-known scientist. Now you might be looking at the module and wondering what the link is to the scientist but Edison is the man who patented the Phonograph, a device that could be used for the recording and playback of sound, just like this module! You can record audio into the internal recording buffer, via the built-in microphone or the jack input, and play it back. It's a 6HP-wide module and is built around the ISD1820. It can produce a wide spectrum of sounds ranging from tasty lofi to absolute glitch fests. 

In case you bought a kit, all SMD components are already soldered onto the board. To finish the build, a number of components are required: 
- 6x Thonkiconn mono jacks
- 2x 100kOhm potentiometer
- 1x 3mm LED (color of choice)
- 3x sub-miniature toggle switches
- 1x 2x5 pinheader (for eurorack power supply)
- 1x ISD1820 
- IC socket for ISD1820
- 1x electret microphone (make sure to buy one with long enough leads, in order to mount it level with the frontplate)
