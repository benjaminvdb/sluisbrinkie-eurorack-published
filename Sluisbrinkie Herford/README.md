# Sluisbrinkie Herford
The Herford is a modern interpretation of a classic 4U design, combining a VCS with Track & Hold and Sample & Hold functionality.

## Notes
The current design has a few points that need to be improved, being:
- So far I haven't found much use for the hot coupler output, so it might be worth removing it and reorganizing the frontpanel a bit for more room around the bottom pots.
- The mounting holes for the switches are a bit big.
